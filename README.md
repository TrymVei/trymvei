### About me
Hello! I'm a frontend developer with a passion for creating visually appealing user interfaces. While my primary expertise lies in frontend development, I'm also proficient in backend development using technologies like .NET.

One thing that sets me apart is my love for learning. I'm constantly seeking out new technologies, frameworks, and tools to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

When it comes to frameworks, I have extensive experience with popular ones like React and Vue. These frameworks allow me to build scalable and efficient web applications. Additionally, I'm also familiar with emerging technologies like Astro, which enables me to create performant static sites.

In terms of developer cred, I'm a big fan of Neovim (nvim). Its powerful features and extensibility make it an invaluable tool in my development workflow. I find joy in customizing and optimizing my development environment to boost productivity and enhance the overall developer experience.

Overall, I'm a dedicated frontend developer who is always eager to expand my skill set and tackle new challenges.
